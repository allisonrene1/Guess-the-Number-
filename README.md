# Guess-the-Number-

This is a simple "guess the number" game for numbers 1 through 20. If a user fails to type
in a number, a prompt will display. If a user's guess is either too high or two low, prompts will display.
Users can guess up to 20 times before the game ends; the user's score will be tracked with each consecutive guess. If the user guesses the correct number, he or she wins, and can continue playing the game by clicking "Play again!". The game will be restored
to its initial condition when "Play again!" is clicked. A high score will begin being tracked for each game that is played.

This is the first project I've ever built. HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I didn't make it responsive with mobile users in mind, as
I've been more focused on learning programming skills (opposed to design and UI).
